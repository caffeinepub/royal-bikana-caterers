  "summary": "Diff adds a 6-page TanStack Router frontend with shared header/footer, themed styling, SEO hook, gallery lightbox, menu tabs, and a contact form wired to a new Motoko backend. Several requirements appear partially met, but key AC gaps remain around About content verbatim, backend stable persistence/return values, and no-reload behavior on Contact success.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "About Us page must render the provided About content exactly (verbatim).",

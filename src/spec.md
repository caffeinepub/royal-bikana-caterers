## Summary
**Goal:** Build a premium Rajputana-themed, multi-page marketing website for Royal Bikana Caterers with core business content, gallery, and contact lead capture.

**Planned changes:**
- Create 6 client-routed pages with responsive header navigation (desktop + hamburger menu): Home, About Us, Services, Menu, Gallery, Contact.
- Apply consistent royal visual design (maroon/wine base, gold accents, subtle Indian patterns, crown/shield motifs) with mobile-first responsive layouts.
- Home page: hero with specified heading/subheading, CTAs to Contact/Menu, and highlights section.
- About page: render the provided About paragraph verbatim with premium readable formatting.
- Services page: show the 8 requested services in an icon + card/grid layout responsive to screen size.
- Menu page: show all provided categories/items exactly, with clear section separation and in-page category navigation (tabs/list/anchors).
- Gallery page: responsive grid with at least 8 relevant placeholder images and a lightbox/modal preview.
- Contact page: show provided phone numbers/location/WhatsApp note, add “Book Now on WhatsApp” button (wa.me deep link), and a contact form with validation and success/failure states.
- Backend: store contact inquiries (name, mobileNumber, eventType, eventDate optional, message, createdAt) and expose methods to create and list inquiries.
- Add a premium footer across all pages with business info and Instagram/WhatsApp icons/links.
- Add basic on-page SEO per page (titles, meta descriptions, semantic headings) and include provided keywords naturally.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a fast, mobile-friendly royal-themed catering website, view services/menu/gallery, and submit inquiries via a form (saved in the backend) or contact instantly via WhatsApp.
